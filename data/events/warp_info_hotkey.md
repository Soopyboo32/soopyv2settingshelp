You will need to open the warp menu (/warp) to let the mod load avalible warps though

A good way of using this is to set it to CHAR_NONE and only change it in mc controld when playing diana

ALSO
when entering a diana lobby, go from spiders den OR farming islands -> lobby, then run /sethubwarp (while standing at the enterance) and from then on it will suggest /hub as an option to warp to spiders den enterance
