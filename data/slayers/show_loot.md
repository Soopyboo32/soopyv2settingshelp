This will only work for zombie-based mobs 
considering most endgame players use tank zombies
This will only hide summons from:
"eman boss hp <= 3m" until "2s after boss is dead"

It hides all zombies just in case someone trying to "lootshare"
It only works for enderman slayer

If you have concerns about using this feature, 
this is why I think it is fine to use:

- sba also has hiding feature (hide players near important npc)
- skyblock rules only suggest that showing hidden mobs is bannable
- it only starts to hide summons from boss hp <= 3m until 2s after boss
   thus it doesnt hide them thru out the entire boss, 
   therefore it doesnt provide any extra informations
   (for the debate of "showing extra informations", showing boss hp 
   on screen seperately is already extra info)

!!! If you still think it is bannable or risky to use,
!!! simply just disable it and don't use it.

!!! If you are an hypixel skyblock staff and have your own concerned,
!!! please contact Soopyboo32#3042 or EmeraldMerchant#2514 on Discord.
